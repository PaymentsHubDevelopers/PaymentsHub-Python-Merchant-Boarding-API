# Automate Merchant Onboarding in a Python App
This is a Python application that demonstrates programmatic merchant onboarding for a Merchant Processing Account using Payments Hub's <a href='https://developer.paymentshub.com/products/fintech-tools/merchant-boarding-api' target='_blank'>Merchant Boarding API</a>. The code in this repository handles the front and back-end processes for creating a new Merchant ID (MID) application and submitting it to Payments Hub for Underwriting.
